Every devloper may faces some issues during programe the projects or maybe appear after ayear or more.  
So there is some kye points the devloper must master.  

>**1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software**  
>
>>The devloper must know the purpose of the software he will write and how can make this software helpful for the user.  
>
>**2. The Goals of Software Design**    
>>The software must be design in easy way so it can be helpful for the devloper and the user.  
>
>**3. (Mis)understanding**  
>>The devloper must understand what he work with and what he wants to do.  
>
>**4. Simlicity**    
>>The good devloper whose make the code as simple as he can so any one can understand it.  
>
>**5. Complexity**    
>>As we said before the devloper must know what he wants and make the every part of the code simple.  
>
>**6. Maintenance**    
>>It is important to reduce the effort of maintenance.    
>
>**7. Consistency**    
>>Consistency make your code easier to understand.    
>
>**8. Prioritizing**    
>>There are three factors that will help the devloper make a better decision:  
>>* The desirability of a change(D)  
>>* The value of a change (V)   
>>* The effort required to perform the change(E)  
>
>**9. Solving Problems**    
>>* Know exactly what is being asked.    
>>* give your self time to plan and analyze the proplem.    
>>* Divide the problem into smaller tasks.  
>
>**10. Good enough is fine**  
>>To make the coding easier you must
>>- Start small, improve it, then extend.  
>
>**11. Predictions**    
>>Don't be predict the future just be generic in what your software need to be.  
>
>**12. Assumptions**    
>>the devloper must code on what he sure not on he think will happen.  
>
>**13. Stop Reinventing**    
>
>**14. Rsistance**    
>>Always reject adding more code until you are sure the software needs this changes.  
>
>**15. Automation**    
>
>**16. Code measurement**    
>>The benefit of the code is not measured by its size.  
>
>**17. Productivity**    
>>You must keep your code as small as possible.  
>
>**18. Testing**    
>>You should test you code in early stage.  
>
>**19. (Under)Estimation**    
>
>**20. Running Away From Rewriting**    
>>Sometimes the devloper think rewriting the code is easier then read it but this all delusion.  
>
>**21. Documentation and Commenting**    
>>The documentation is important so the a new devloper can understand the software as a whole.  
We need the comments when the code is complex.  
>
>**22. Picking Technologies**    
>>There is some factors you should consider before you start using technology:    
>>* Is there active devlopment behind it?    
>>* Will it continue to be maintained?    
>>* How easy is it to switch away from?    
>>* What does the community say about it?  
>
>**23. Self-Development**    
>>Keep reading and updating your knowloge.  
>
>**24. Don't be a hero**    
>>Don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it.  
>
>**25. Don't Ask Questions..Ask for Help**    
>>When you have any problem just try to find the solution by your self read, search and when you tried every thing now is the best time to seek advice.
